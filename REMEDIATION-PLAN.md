## Technical Debt Remediation Plan

### Priority Classification
- **P0 (Critical - 0-2 weeks)**: Security vulnerabilities requiring immediate attention
- **P1 (High - 2-8 weeks)**: Production stability and performance issues
- **P2 (Medium - 2-3 months)**: Quality and maintainability improvements
- **P3 (Low - 3+ months)**: Optimization and enhancement opportunities

### Current Issues Analysis

| Issue | Priority | Risk Level | Business Impact |
|-------|----------|------------|-----------------|
| Hardcoded API keys | P0 | Critical | Security breach, compliance violations |
| No error monitoring | P1 | High | Poor incident response, difficult debugging |
| Local file storage | P1 | High | Scalability bottleneck, data loss risk |
| Limited test coverage | P2 | Medium | Higher bug rate, slower development |
| Monolithic architecture | P2 | Medium | Scaling limitations (covered in microservices plan) |

## P0 - Critical Security Issues (0-2 weeks)

### 1. API Keys Security Migration

**Current State**: All AI provider API keys hardcoded in `application.properties`
**Target State**: Secure secret management with rotation capability

#### Implementation Plan:

**Phase 1: Environment Variables (Week 1)**
```bash
# Backend changes required:
1. Update application.properties to use ${ENV_VAR} syntax
2. Create environment-specific property files
3. Add startup validation for required secrets
4. Update deployment scripts to inject environment variables
```

**Phase 2: Docker Environment Management (Week 2)**
```bash
# For Docker deployment:
1. Create .env files for each environment (dev/staging/prod)
2. Update Docker Compose to use environment variables
3. Implement secret management with Docker secrets or external vault
4. Add environment validation and health checks
```

**Files to modify:**
- `backend/src/main/resources/application.properties` - Replace hardcoded keys
- `deployment/deploy-backend.sh` - Add environment variable injection
- Create `docker-compose.yml` and environment-specific `.env` files
- Update `backend/src/main/java/com/fbadsautomation/config/` classes

**Success Metrics:**
- Zero hardcoded secrets in version control
- Environment-specific configuration management
- Secure local development setup with Docker Compose
- Production deployment with proper secret injection


## Phase 1 Implementation

1. **Environment Variable Migration**
   - Migrate all hardcoded API keys from `application.properties` to environment variables
   - Create secure configuration templates (`.env.template`, `.env.example`, `.env.production.template`)
   - Implement Spring Boot property resolution with fallback defaults

2. **Docker Development Environment** 
   - Create `docker-compose.yml` with all services (backend, frontend, PostgreSQL, Redis)
   - Add multi-stage Dockerfiles for both backend and frontend
   - Implement health checks and proper security practices (non-root users)
   - Create comprehensive Docker documentation in `docker/README.md`

3. **Production Deployment Security**
   - Update systemd service to source environment variables from `.env` file
   - Enhance deployment script with environment validation
   - Implement proper file permissions (600) for secrets
   - Add security hardening to systemd service



## Phase 3 Implementation

1. **Storage Abstraction Layer**
   - Created `StorageService` interface for pluggable storage backends
   - Implemented `LocalStorageService` for file system storage
   - Implemented `MinIOStorageService` for S3-compatible object storage
   - Added `StorageConfig` for environment-based storage type selection
   - Automatic bucket creation and configuration validation

2. **MinIO Integration**
   - Complete MinIO setup with Docker Compose integration
   - Presigned URL generation for secure file access
   - Public URL generation for direct file serving
   - File metadata management and storage optimization
   - Health checks and connection monitoring

3. **Storage Configuration Management**
   - Environment variable configuration for storage types (`STORAGE_TYPE=local|minio`)
   - Flexible configuration supporting multiple storage backends
   - Fallback mechanisms and error handling
   - Production-ready storage patterns
